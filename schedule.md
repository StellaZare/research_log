=================
## Stage 1 (End of May)
Be able to realize simple VANET application

### Week 1 
* Set up NS-3 - Done
* Set up SUMO 
* Test with example codes

### Week 2
* Get familiar with generating SUMO mobility traces
* Be able to build static network topologies (wireless links) 
* run on/off applications (using global routing)

### Week 3
* Use SUMO mobility traces (use locations of the vehicles at a particular time) to generate a snapshot of the current vehicular network topology and run the on/off application and measure network performance.

### Week 4: Use complete mobility trace to test with on/off application. 

## Stage 2 (End of June): Set up the desired network environment and implement QCRP

## Stage 3 (End of July): Code improvement and Design experiments

## Stage 4 (End of August): Paper/Report writing
